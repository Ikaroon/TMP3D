1. Open the package manager in Unity from `Window>Package Manager`
2. Select the `+` dropdown button in the top-left corner of the package manager
3. Select `Add package from git URL...`
4. Enter `https://github.com/Ikaroon/TMP3D.git` as url and confirm

## How to use
To understand how to setup a TextMeshPro for 3D you can check out the sample in the package. For downloading that follow these steps:
1. Open the package manager in Unity from `Window>Package Manager`
2. Select `Text Mesh Pro 3D Support` in the section `Ikaroon`
3. Expand `Samples`
4. Click `Import` next to `Solid Text`
5. Now open the scene from `Assets/Samples/Text Mesh Pro 3D Support/<version>/Solid Text/Scenes/Sample_TMP3D`

If you still need help, here are some steps how you setup a TextMeshPro for 3D:
1. Create a new FontAsset by using the `Font Asset Creator` from `Window>Text Mesh Pro>Font Asset Creator`
2. Expand the created Asset and select the Material
3. Change the Material's shader to `TextMeshPro/3D/Unlit`
4. Create a TextMeshPro in a scene from `3D Object>Text - TextMeshPro` NOT from `UI>Text - TextMeshPro` this is not supported yet.
5. Add a TMP3D_Handler component from `Script>Ikaroon.TMP3D>TMP3D_Handler`
6. Apply the FontAsset to the TextMeshPro component
7. You have now acces to 3D text!
